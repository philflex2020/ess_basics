Consider this system setup


ERCOT

                         outstation
                                                site1    
                                    master     
                                                outstation      
                                                             modbus client
                                    master

consider the voltageSP var
we'll give it self routing names

GMS1_VOLTSP             grid1/sub1/VOLTSP      sub1/VOLTSP          VOLTSP

set path
set GMS1_VOLTSP 
                        set /components/grid1/sub1/VOLTSP 
                                               
                                              set /components/sub1/VOLTSP 

                                                                   set <uri>/VOLTSP

pub path 
site_sub1 gets a pub and seds the value back to master
                                                                   pub <uri>/VOLTSPFB 

 grid1 master issues a pub picked up by grid1 outstation                                                                   
                                            pub /components/sub1/VOLTSPFB
FM master issues a pub for FM outstation  
                        pub /components/grid1/sub1/VOLTSPFB
                                           
names

outbound path 
ERCOT
sets  GMS1_VOLTSP                                           
FM outstation
    {
        "id":"grid1/sub1/VOLTSP",
        "uri":"/components"
    }

    sets /components/grid1/sub1/VOLTSP    

FM Master for grid1
    {
        "id":"sub1/VOLTSP",
        "uri":"/components"
    }
    sees /components/grid1/   sub1/VOLTSP
Grid1 outstation
    {
        "id":"sub1/VOLTSP",
        "uri":"/components"
    }

    sets /components/sub1/VOLTSP

grid1 master for sub1
    { 
        "id":"VOLTSP",
        "uri":"/components"
    }
sub1 outstation
    {
        "id":"VOLTSP",
        "uri":"<myuri>"
    }

    sets <myuri>/VOLTSP


inbound path
sub1 outstation sees
pub on <myuri>/VOLTFB
sends back to master on grid1 

grid1 master issues a pub on /components/sub1 '{"sub1/VOLTFB":value,...}'
grid1 outstation sees pub and updates FM grid1 master 

FM grid1 master issues pub for /components/grid1 '{"grid1/sub1/VOLTFB":value,...}'
FM ERCOT outstation can then send the reply to the correct type/index
